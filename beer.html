             <h1>Brewing Beer!</h1>

             <p>Nice little view of Lake Union</p>
             <p>Brewing beer started as a hobby, but is something I have really grown passionate about (I suppose it's still a hobby though) </p>
             <p>It has been quite the process of figuring out which inputs (malt, temperature, filtering, and so many more) really lead to good beer</p>
             <p>I have learned that keeping detailed notes about how we might have "deviated" from the recipe (sometimes on purpose, sometime not) is really
              important</p>
             <p>People always ask if I am saving any money by brewing my own beer, and in my mind I would like to think that I am.... but the reality is that
              every beer I brew at home probably costs about as much as from the store (if not more)</p>
             <p>And it has really made me appreciate how much skill and effort goes into every bottle or can of beer that we causally buy at the store</p>
             <br>
