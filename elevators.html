             <h1>Forecasting Elevators!</h1>
             <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>So, I really did not like the elevators at our old building</p>
            <p>It seemed like an entriniy between the time that you called an elevator and one showed up </p>
            <p>I felt that elevators could be made better, and that waiting around to be called was inefficient</p>
            <p>My theroy was that in the mornings, everyone probably wanted to catch an elevator from the first floor on their way to work</p>
            <p>And in eveneings, the oppostie would occur. Few people if anybody, would catch an elevator from the first floor, but everyone wanted to go there</p>
            <p>So, I configued an old financal forcasting model (ARMA) to work with elevators</p>
            <p>I used time of day, and floor where the elevator was called as inputs </p>
            <p>With the goal of reducing "floors missed" when a person comes to elevator</p>

           <div class="content-wrapper-info">
             <h2>Process</h2>

            <p>Finding actual data about what time and what floor people got on an elevators turned out to be very difficult</p>
            <p>Who know that kind of data was not just "out there"</p>
            <p>So I ended up making a few sets of semi-random data</p>
            <p>I collapsed the the exact times into 10 mintue intervals to reduce nosie (My thought is,
               this would not have a huge impact, because the largest gains came at the beinging of the day)</p>
            <p>Then run an ARMA on that data, then compare it to how a elevator would normally preform</p>
            <p>I also wanted to compare it to the theoretical situation where the elevator would go to a random floor between trips becuase that sounded fun</p>

           </div>
           <div class="content-wrapper-info">
             <h2>Results</h2>

            <p>On the left were the results of using the forecasted floor vs. a random floor vs. the perious floor</p>
            <p>Its kinda hard to tell, but using the forecasted floor made the elevator on avg about 50% closer to where it needed to be</p>
            <p>And that moving randomly between pickups was just about as good as waiting</p>
            <p>Theoretical next steps would be to get actual data to work with and try out different models to see if I could imporove even more</p>
