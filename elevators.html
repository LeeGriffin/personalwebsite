             <h1>Elevators!</h1>

            <p>I wanted to make a smarter elevator</p>
            <p>I felt that elevators waiting a their last floor, waiting to be called was just about the least effiecnt thing they could do</p>
            <p>My theroy was that in the mornings, everyone probably wanted to catch an elevator from the first floor on their way to work</p>
            <p>And in eveneings, the oppostie would occur. Few people if anybody, was catching an elevator from the first floor, but everyone was going there</p>
            <p>So I configued an old financal forcasting model to work with elevators</p>
            <p>I used time of day, and floor where the elevator was called as inputs </p>
            <p>With the goal of reducing "floors missed" </p>
