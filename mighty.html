             <h1>Where it all began</h1>

             <p>Alright, that might be a <b>little</b>  dramatic</p>
             <p>Having said that, it's hard to imagine a better first job out of college. I had found a place where hard work was valued, coworkers who were empathic and helpful,
               and had a culture that encouraged me to add skills and move within the company</p>
            <p>I was able to learn new skills, (project management, R, BPO management), hone skills I already had (SQL, data analysis, working within a team),
              and learn about the awesome industry that is machine teaching (and self driving cars in particular)</p>
             <p>From the christmas parties to the late nights, I remember almost all of it all fondely</p>

           <h2>Oh, how could I not include the people I worked with in their own section?</h2>
           <p>I got to work with some amazingly empathic and thoughtful people</p>
           <p>They encouraged and helped be develop skills that were helpful to my job at mighty & beyond</p>
           <p>They were there with praise during the good times and with support when I needed them</p>
           <p>Some of whom I still have the pleasure of working with at Uber ATG</p>
           <p>Hopefully, I will get the chance to work with most of them someday in the future</p>
           <p>Cheers!</p>
