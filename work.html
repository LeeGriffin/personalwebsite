             <h2>What do I like most about working at Uber?</h2>

            <h4>The People</h4>
            <p>A Lot of the phenomenal people I had the chance to work with at Mighty.ai also came over to work for Uber</p>
            <p>In the year since we were acquired, I have also gotten to know and work with a ton of awesome people who come from the Uber ATG side</p>
            <p>I am beyond lucky to work with a group of such empathic, transparent, and hardworking individuals</p>
            <h4>The Unique Challenges</h4>
            <p>I really enjoy having a job where there is a set start point and end point, but the no clear </p>
            <p>It is great to work in a cutting edge industry and projects that will have an impact</p>
            <p>Defining processes in a new environment, delivering a completed set of data, and working with some of my closest friends
            really makes the job worth while</p>
